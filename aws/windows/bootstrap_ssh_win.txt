# This makes use of the ssh-host-config utility provided as part of the
# openssh package. The util expects to be run from within a Cygwin terminal
# since it depends on a number of environment variables that are configured
# and set when the Cygwin environment is initialised. As such we to need to
# chain together a command to start up a tty running bash that will run our
# configuration script.
# Unfortunately, Cygwin fails to set a value for the 'LOGONSERVER'
# environment variable - this is presumably because of the early stage at
# which the AWS User Data script is run. Unfortunately this causes a number
# of problems as the helper scripts we are using assume that this value is
# set. The scripts make a number of decisions regarding the name and set up
# of the priviliged user account that the ssh server service is to run under
# based on this value - see the csih_select_priviliged_username function
# within the cygwin-service-installation-helper.sh script.
# If the value is not set we end up with an plethora of errors setting up
# the account with the end result being a baulked and inoperable ssh server
# installation.
# We want a single directory for the user home rather than separate
# Windows and *nix/Cygwin home directories (which is the default).

# the username, the only 100% reliable method is to look up the user profile
